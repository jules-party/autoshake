# autoshake for fisch

* just run the `main.py` file using python :p
* yes... ill setup a pyenv, one day...

## Default Keybinds
You can change these in the `config.yaml` file, keybinds based in *pyautoit*.
* **F4**: Toggle autoshake on and off
* **F8**: Exit Program

## Screen Size
* Default is set to 3440x1440, because that is what i use, obviously change this if you have a different resolution which you probably do.

## Image / Button Image
* `button_img` in config is what the image the program bases the shake button off of
* **YOU** have to provide these yourself, simply screen shot the text of the button and crop it and then save it somewhere preferably near the `main.py` file.
* Then simply change the `button_img` value in the config
